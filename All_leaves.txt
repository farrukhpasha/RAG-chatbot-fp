1.3. A female employee having given birth to a child, will also be eligible to apply for parental leave for up to

1.4. AKU will also permit paid paternity leave of ten (10) working days to eligible male employees and staff
trainees to provide their registered spouses the required support to care for the newly born/adopted child.

of the country, the policy of the AKU providing a higher entitlement will prevail, and vice versa, i.e., if
the legal requirement of the country is more than that prescribed by AKU, the legal requirement of the
respective countries will prevail.

2. PURPOSE
2.1. AKU recognizes the importance of facilitating female employees and staff trainees who are in a family way
to avail leave for childbirth and care of the newborn, and for facilitating her return to regular full-time work
responsibilities. This Policy provides the required framework for facilitating eligible female employees for
this.
2.2. AKU also recognises the need to facilitate eligible male employees and staff trainees to support their wives

without pay.

3.1.2.

Male employees will not be eligible for paternity leave while on probation. If leave is required, they
